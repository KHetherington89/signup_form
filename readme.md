This page was created as part of the Odin Project intermediate HTML/CSS course.

The page is primarily layed out using flexbox, with grid layout for the form
elements.

Most of the form validation is done with the built-in validation, such as
patterns and length requirements. Custom JS validation is done to check that 
passwors are the same, and that all require fields are filled.

CSS effects prompt users as to the validity of their inputs.
